# Welcome to the Ecommerce Store API! ðŸ›’

The Ecommerce Store API is your gateway to managing products, categories, and reviews for a modern online store. Whether youâ€™re a store owner adding new products or a customer leaving reviews, this API has everything you need to build and run a fully functional ecommerce platform!

### What Can You Do?  
With the Ecommerce Store API, you have access to a range of powerful features:

- **Categories**: Organize your store by managing product categories. Use these endpoints to:
  - **Get All Categories**: View every category in your store.
  - **Get Category by ID**: Retrieve details for a specific category.
  - **Create, Update, or Delete Categories**: Add new categories, make updates, or remove them when theyâ€™re no longer needed.

- **Products**: Easily manage your product catalog. You can:
  - **Get All Products**: See everything you have in stock.
  - **Get Product by ID**: View detailed information about a specific product.
  - **Create, Update, or Delete Products**: Add new products, make changes to existing ones, or remove products no longer available for sale.

- **Reviews**: Collect customer feedback with reviews. You can:
  - **Get All Reviews**: Browse all reviews for different products.
  - **Get Review by ID**: See details about a specific review.
  - **Create, Update, or Delete Reviews**: Add new reviews, update them, or remove unwanted reviews from the system.

### User Authentication ðŸ”‘  
Before you can manage categories, products, or reviews, youâ€™ll need to register and log in. Hereâ€™s how it works:
- **Register**: Sign up with your email and password to create an account.
- **Log In**: Once registered, log in to receive a **JWT token**. This token grants you access to the more advanced features, such as creating, updating, and deleting categories, products, and reviews.

Without the token, you can still browse the store and view all available products and reviews, but any changes to the system require authentication.
